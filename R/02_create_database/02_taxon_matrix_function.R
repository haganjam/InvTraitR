#' @description The different taxonomic levels and the distances (weights) between them for the GBIF taxonomic backbone
#'
#' @details This method relies on having a taxonomic framework which describes how different
#' species are taxonomically related to each other. The GBIF taxonomic backbone uses the seven
#' major Linnaen ranks (i.e. kingdom, phylum, class, order, family, genus and species). It also
#' includes sub-species and varieties (https://data-blog.gbif.org/post/gbif-backbone-taxonomy/).
#' Details of the backbone can be found at: https://data-blog.gbif.org/post/gbif-backbone-taxonomy/.
#' Then, we assign numerical distances between taxonomic levels where one unit reflects on whole
#' major Linnaen rank. Since we only consider ranks from order to species, the distances were chosen
#' as: 1, 1 and 1/4 (for genus to species). We create the distance matrix using igraph. This link was
#' useful for setting this up: https://kevintshoemaker.github.io/NRES-746/graph.theory.html

# build igraph from the input matrix
tax.g <- graph_from_data_frame(d = tax.mat, directed=FALSE)

# calculate taxononomic distance between each taxonomic level
tax.d <- distances(
